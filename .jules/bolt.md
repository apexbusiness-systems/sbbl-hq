## 2026-04-16 - Store Architecture Hardening
**Learning:** Migrating from ad-hoc JSON carts to explicit structured tables like `store_orders` and `custom_quote_requests` simplifies Worker webhook handling.
**Action:** Ensure that new commerce features build against the canonical `store_*` namespace directly to preserve idempotency and referential integrity.

## 2025-05-14 - [Performance] Optimized Ops Batch Product Insertion
**Learning:** Sequential database inserts in a loop (N+1 query pattern) in Cloudflare Workers significantly increase latency due to multiple round-trips to the database.
**Action:** Use Supabase's native batch insert capability () to perform multiple insertions in a single database call, reducing I/O overhead and improving response times.

**Learning:** Sequential database inserts in a loop (N+1 query pattern) in Cloudflare Workers significantly increase latency due to multiple round-trips to the database.
**Action:** Use Supabase's native batch insert capability (`insert([...items])`) to perform multiple insertions in a single database call, reducing I/O overhead and improving response times.

## 2026-04-21 - [Performance] Optimized Store Checkout Loop
**Learning:** The previous implementation used an O(N^2) array reduction in `handleCheckout` by looking up products and existing items via `.find()` repeatedly. This could cause main-thread blocking when rendering with large product catalogues or many cart items.
**Action:** Utilize O(1) dictionary lookups by reading from the already memoized `productMap` and grouping items via a `Record` instead of checking for duplicates via `.find()` in an array accumulator.
